I still remember those first few weeks

how I'd unlock my phone
just to see if your name was there
How my heart would skip a beat whenever it was.

I remember how photos of you made me smile like an idiot.
How I'd replay your voice in my head after we spoke.
How even just knowing I'd get to hear you later even if just on a call made the whole day feel electric.

It felt like
something new.
something rare

And the funny thing is,
I still feel it.

Because those feelings never really went away.
They just settled in and became love.

I still skip a beat wheni unlock my phone to see ifyou texted and when you had.
I get a moment of panic when i realise you texted and i missed responding.
I still fawn over when i see you send me a photo, especialllllly when unprompted.
I still die to hear you voice even if I cannot see you, just on a call, I do.


I apologise, I make things hard
I apologise, I made you feel as though, you were not enough, because you are
you do not trouble me nor do i have issues with each and every thing you do, i do not
and I'm so troubled by the fact i cannot call you and tell this to you in my voice
because a text is not enough
I cannot give it to you in writing but maybe telling you these this way might be more compelling.

I do not apologisse just to apologise,
I mean that I did not mean to do that

I hope you understand that you are very important t me ad you will never not be.
Just you being there is what I wish at the moment and that will always be true no matter what else chaanges.
