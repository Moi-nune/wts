            <p className="verse">
              how I'd unlock my phone<br />
              just to see if your name was there<br />
              How my heart would skip a beat whenever it was.
            </p>
            
            <p className="verse">
              I remember how photos of you made me smile like an idiot.<br />
              How I'd replay your voice in my head after we spoke.<br />
              How even just knowing I'd get to hear you later even if just on a call made the whole day feel electric.
            </p>
            
            <p className="verse">
              It felt like<br />
              something new.<br />
              something rare
            </p>
            
            <p className="verse">
              And the funny thing is,<br />
              I still feel it.
            </p>
            
            <p className="verse">
              Because those feelings never really went away.<br />
              They just settled in and became love.
            </p>
            
            <p className="verse">
              I still skip a beat when I unlock my phone to see if you texted and when you had.<br />
              I get a moment of panic when I realise you texted and I missed responding.<br />
              I still fawn over when I see you send me a photo, especialllllly when unprompted.<br />
              I still die to hear your voice even if I cannot see you, just on a call, I do.
            </p>
            
            <p className="verse">
              I apologise, I make things hard<br />
              I apologise, I made you feel as though, you were not enough, because you are<br />
              you do not trouble me nor do I have issues with each and every thing you do, I do not<br />
              and I'm so troubled by the fact I cannot call you and tell this to you in my voice<br />
              because a text is not enough<br />
              I cannot give it to you in writing but maybe telling you these this way might be more compelling.
            </p>
            
            <p className="verse">
              I do not apologise just to apologise,<br />
              I mean that I did not mean to do that
            </p>
            
            <p className="verse">
              I hope you understand that you are very important to me and you will never not be.<br />
              Just you being there is what I wish at the moment and that will always be true no matter what else changes.
